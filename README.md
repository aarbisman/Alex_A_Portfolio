## [Project #1: Predicting UFC Match Outcomes](https://github.com/aarbisman/ufc_prediction/blob/master/ufc_prediction.ipynb)

* Examines a dataset from a sport with a high level of data variance.

* Utilizes null imputing/dropping, data scaling, and t-test based feature screening to preprocess Data.

* Employs Cross-Validated Hyperparameter Grid Searching accross three different models, spanning 8,000+ model fittings to find optimal hyperparameter set.

* Combines optimized models into an ensemble classification model to improve accuracy.

## [Project #2: Finding distinctions in DND monsters using clustering](https://github.com/aarbisman/dnd_monster_clustering/blob/main/clustering_basic_v1.ipynb)
* Attempts to find meaningful distinctions in high-variance, low observation count data.

* Compares centroid-based k-nearest neighbor clustering to hierarchical clustering algorithms in terms of making meaningful distinctions.

* Examines results of clustering algorithms using scatterplots.

## [Project #3: Creating an optimal fantasy hockey roster using a Dynamic programming algorithm](https://github.com/aarbisman/knappsack_nhl/blob/main/different_iterations_of_drafting_algorithm.ipynb)
* Sets up a daily fantasy draft like a modified version of a knapsack problem

* Solves this problem using dynamic programming algorithm, centered around a dictionary of nested lists.

* Adds features to this algorithm to make it compatible with DraftKings' daily fantasy draft.

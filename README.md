## [Project #1: Predicting UFC Match Outcomes](https://github.com/aarbisman/ufc_prediction/blob/master/ufc_prediction.ipynb)

* Examines a dataset from a sport with a high level of data variance.

* Utilizes null imputing/dropping, data scaling, and t-test based feature screening to preprocess Data.

* Employs Cross-Validated Hyperparameter Grid Searching accross three different models, spanning 8,000+ model fittings to find optimal hyperparameter set.

* Combines optimized models into an ensemble classification model to improve accuracy.
